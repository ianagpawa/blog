Welcome to my blog!  I like to develop web applications in my free time and this serves to document my thought process.  It's an attempt to impose an artificial structure on the stream of consciousness of a software engineer; a peek behind the logic and reasoning of the code.  I hope you enjoy the coherent chaos, ca va sans dire.
