Welcome to my blog!  I like to develop web applications and this serves to document my thought process.  It's a peek behind the logic and reasoning of the code; an attempt to impose an artificial structure on the stream of consciousness of a software engineer.  

I hope you enjoy the coherent chaos, ca va sans dire.
