I started breaking down the template into components, so far so good.  I abstracted the repeating parts and made them into templates, and it's looking pretty good so far.  I need to integrate the API, which shouldn't be too hard.  Pagination needs to be done, but i'll deal with that later, as well as the search, but for now, pretty happy with my progress.

I also need to update the links on my portfolio to open new tabs, and consider creating components in this blog for movie/show recs, currently listening to (maybe spotify), and a random quote section.  That'd make the front page less sparse and more interesting.
