Worked on a few changes to the weather app.  I added another card to each row so the responsiveness wouldn't break.  Maybe after cleaning everything up, I can work on that part of it, but it's not very urgent; more info on the screen isn't necessarily a bad thing.

Updated the configuration for github, and deploying it from /root of the gh-pages branch.  I need to automate the deploy process; easy as adding scripts in the package.

Need to add the search feature back on there and still need to update the styling for the current day.  Overall, decently satisfied with the overall project, but I probably could've used a better template layout.  I can always rework it later; template is easy.
