Finished revamping my newsfeed web app.  I used a Colorlib template and converted it to Angular components using PrimeNg.  I'm pretty happy with the results, clean and simple.  I still need to do a lot of clean up, and probably integrate a search functionality, maybe a loader.  But other than that, I really like the new look.  It's so much easier to just use a template layout than trying to come up with your own and its pretty responsive.  My original layout looked terrible.  I guess that's why I'm not a UI/UX designer.

Next on the list is the weather app revamp.
Then I need to figure out how to integrate a random quote, movie/show and music recs to the blog.
