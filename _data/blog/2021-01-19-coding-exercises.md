title: Coding Exercises
---
I've been getting back into coding exercises.  I am super rusty on my algorithms.  I am trying some leetcode questions, which seem to be wildly inconsistent.  Some of the medium ones are super easy, and there was one easy one that was super hard.  Some of the questions are straight up incoherent.  I guess if you were familiar with the topics, you would understand what they were trying to go for, but its nonsensical sometimes.  Regardless, its interesting trying to understand algorithms, even more interesting piecing together what the tests are accepting.

I understand the value of using coding exercises as an assessment but I feel I don't get to use whatever I learned in being able to solve coding exercises in my day-to-day coding experience.  I can see some of the lessons being applied to the architectural design of the systems, but I've never had the pleasure of implementing something that required such complexity.
