I was working on converting the contact page.  The Delog starter was using some service for the form collection, so I decided to try to transplant the previous blog's contact form.  I tried it on local multiple times, and updating accordingly, but wasn't working.  I looked at the official documnetation and the example given and for the love of me, I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working.  Then I decided to boot up the old blog and try submitting it via local.  It didn't work either, so I thought maybe it just doesn't work on local for some reason.  I commented out the contact page links, replaced it a link to my portfolio on the header and deployed.  Taking out the links was a good idea since if it didn't work, a user wouldn't really know to navigate to it, and you can still test it by going to /contact.  Now submission works, but I need to style the page.  I also need to add links to the code base.  The only other thing left would be to slice the blogposts at 6 on the home page, the most recent 6, and put the rest in a list on a separate page, maybe add a search and sort as well.  It's on this week's todo list.
