I started messing around with docker and it's pretty interesting and rather easy.  The initial part of trying to learning the commands took some time initially, but was pretty effortless afterwards.  Docker is important since it packages codebases into containers and allows them to run on virtually any machine.  It basically solves the problem of isolating software applications from their system environments, allowing developers to share their apps across systems without having to worry about pre-installing software or messing with configurations.  Apps are instead standardized into containers.
