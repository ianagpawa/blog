I haven't been feeling well so I've been taking it easy.  I think my allergies are acting up again; I really should get that checked out.

Works been BAU; still working on issues with Apache, particularly mod_auth_openidc configs.  I think I was able to fix one issue by reducing the max number of state tokens as well as reducing the state timeout.  Still trying to figure out the other two issues, which is a bit daunting since I'm having difficulty reproducing the issue.  

In other news, just started trying to learn Docker.  It seems like something I should know, and it'll be helping in debugging server issues.  I'm thinking of trying to figure out how to create an image of an httpd server installed on Centos, and then iterate that to have Apache as a reverse proxy to serve a single page application.  I think I'm going to prioritize the first part of the project and then switch to creating a Spring Boot API.
