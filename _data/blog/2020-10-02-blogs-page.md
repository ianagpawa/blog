I added a blogs page to the blog.  I trimmed the number of posts visible on the index page down to 6, and then created a new blogs path where all the blogs are listed.  I still have to add a search bar, but that'll be done later.  I think my next task is to add a recommendations page that I'm thinking of doing.

I also still have to add a search bar to the weather app for searching city conditions.  I think I might do that first instead.
