title: This Must Be The Place
---
Work has been a bit tedious but slow.  A lot of the UI work is on hold since the backend has to revise their approach to the current feature we're working on.  It gives me time to work on my technical debt issues.  

My team lead is leaving the company with tomorrow being his last day.  He was the lead for the Unification team, which encompasses several UI applications as well as a few BFF apps.  Anything that was related to the UI was basically within his purview, which is quite a lot, and I'm astonished as to how he seemingly did it all and made it seem so effortless.  

I think of him as my mentor since he's pretty much the one person I can turn to that will always have an answer for me, no matter now esoteric or confusing or complicated an issue is.  I strive to be as good as he is, and I know I have such a long way to go. To be honest, I feel a little uneasy with him leaving; I've always felt like I've had him to fallback on, as a security blanket.  Although, I can also view this as an opportunity to mature and develop on my own.
