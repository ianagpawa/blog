title: Mod_Auth_OpenIDC
---
Still working on a ticket at work where the auth flow is acting a bit wonky.  Under some instances, a user logs in and proceeds through the portal but gets served a login failure template.  I've been reading through a lot of the mod_auth docs, just going through all the OIDC config settings, and trying to figure out how its going wrong.  It's painstaking but at least I'm learning some things.  I've been looking at a lot of the apache logs, which has been actually pretty interesting as well and took me back a bit in the past when I encountered issues in apache.  Any way, gotta keep on keepin' on.
