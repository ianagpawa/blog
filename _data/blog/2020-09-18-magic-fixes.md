Resolved the issue with mod_auth_openidc.  Looks like my last changes yesterday fixed it, I just didn't get a chance to test it out.  Strange.

I get to create a new React component in the next sprint.  That'll be interesting since it'll be my first real one yet.  I've been working on Shell, which is a React app that serves the rest of our applications, which are in Angular.  I've been working on integrating our new authentication system with Secure Access Management (SAM) in Shell, but that has not required the creation of any new React components.  Rest of the tickets are the usual work in the admin app.

This is the final sprint before we merge SAM changes to master.  Everything seems to be on track, but it still feels a little stressful.
