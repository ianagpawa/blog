title: RESTful
---
I created a RESTful web service for some of my personal favorite quotes.  It's using Java Spring Boot, along with Spring Web, JPA, and in-memory database with H2.  I've only created the bare bones of the service, but so far, the list of functionality includes retrieving all quotes, create a quote, get a quote, update a quote, and delete a quote.  I still have to flesh out the loading script to add more quotes, and then figure out a way to implement a random quote, probably just use a random number (below the number of quotes) and use that as the position and get the id for that random quote.  Should work.  Let's see tomorrow.
