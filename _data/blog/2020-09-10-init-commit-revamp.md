So, I decided to abandon my newly created blog and create another one since I like this layout and styling a lot more.  I also like how much cleaner the code seems with this starter code.  My other blog is less than two days old, but c'est la vie.  As with my older blog, I created this one using Gatsby, React and Netlify.  I had to configure the [starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/stackrole/gatsby-starter-foundation) project to use Github for Oauth.  I didn't feel like dealing with another password to remember.

I took out the `about` and `contact` routes since they seemed unnecessary.  I have to delete their templates, do general clean up, and then figure out how to change the image cards on the landing page to showcase my personal projects.  I need to find and download free images to use. All that's for another day, but for now, I guess this is Round 2.

Actually, the count is probably higher than that considering how many older blogs I have.  Regardless, I hope this one lasts; ca va sans dire.
