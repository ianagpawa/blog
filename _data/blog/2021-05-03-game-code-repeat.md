title: Game.Code.Repeat

I started a Youtube channel for gaming.  Well, as of right now, it is solely gaming, but I will add coding videos to it eventually.  I'm still trying to figure out what sorts of coding things I should put in it; should it be algorithm stuff, or actual practical things like making web applications, or maybe just showing off random coding related things, like creating a VM in windows and installing a docker image in linux, setting up servers, etc.  

What I do have up at the moment are gaming videos, mainly from Battlefield 4, Battlefield 1, and South Park: The Fractured but Whole DLCs.  I already have all of Mafia 3 recorded as well as Shadow of War, I just need to splice them together and publish them on to a playlist.  A majority of the public videos are of PC gameplay from Battlefield 4, I've only just started putting up Xbox One gameplay from Battlefield 1.  I do have unlisted playlists that hold Xbox One clips from Battlefield 1, Battlefield 4 and Battlefield V.  I'm still trying to decide whether I should add my logo on them and rerender the ones that are already up, I probably should.

I should have thought to do this earlier. I already play these video games and I enjoy getting into the video editing and slicing things up.  My brother did all the logos and the animation for the intro.  I might ask him to create some more elements and assets. 

Right now, I've got a pretty janky set up.  On Xbox One, I'm recording everything using the native recording app that ships with the console.  I've plugged in a regular 64 GB usb drive with USB 3.0.  I was using that initially just to record the game clips, but I've started recording whole matches.  After recording, I transfer the usb to my PC and copy the files.  Recording on PC is a lot easier, I just open up an instance of OBS, boot up my game, and start recording.  For video editing, I use Da Vinci's Resolve, which was pretty easy to learn but I'm sure it'll take quite some time to actually master video editing.  There's still a whole bunch I've got to do.  Right now, I'm adding the intro and icons my brother gave me and am using music from Youtube's free Audio library, and splicing the video together that way.  I'm sure as time goes on, it'll get more complicated. 

I'm thinking of making game clips from all the videos I've got and using that instead of having the Xbox One moments, that way I can add my logo watermarks.  I could also eventually make compilations and maybe even do a game impressions/review type thing down the line.
