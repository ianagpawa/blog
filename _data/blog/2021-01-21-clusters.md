title: Clusters
---
One of our dev clusters stopped working.  DevOps were unable to fix the underlying cause so they created a new cluster and migrated everything over.  There were some issues rebuilding the environments, particularly issues with the new openidc provider we're using, but it was surprisingly rather quick.  I must say, I'm rather impressed with our infrastructure and its robustness, even despite this hiccup.  

Because of the migration, I was having issues with the cypress test stage for gitlab pipelines.  I had to rework some of the network stubbing.  It's really weird, I'm not sure why its doing that, but it has some weird particulars with the beforeEach hooks. Anyway, these tests are suppose to run without a live environment, hence the need for network stubbing.  Most network calls were being stubbed, but there was a minor one that wasn't, so I added that.  The only other issue really was the placement of the network stub declarations, and whether or not they were being used as a cypress command or as a constant.  Maybe it has something to do with hoisting.
