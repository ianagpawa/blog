title: Prod

We had our software release last weekend, my first one to prod, which was exciting; and I was on call, which was terrifying.  Overall, it was a pretty smooth release, no issues with deployment, which was rather impressive.  There were some issues encountered during working hours, but were isolated to a specific set of users that were using a type of flow that was not in line with our system, so it was an issue that originated outside of our changes, which was a relief.  Still, it had to resolved and it was, rather quickly I might add.  I'm rather unexpectedly delighted and impressed with our teams.
