I'm working on revamping my blog... yet again.  I'm not going to start from scratch this time.  I'll just created a whole new branch on this current one, and then just update the markdown files with the necessary props; easy enough, but a bit tedious.  Maybe a script?

I have to provide a KT session again; I'm a little rusty but it'll be fine.  It'll be interesting revisiting the previous app.

After this blog revamp, I'll probably want to revamp my portfolio as well.  I found another template that I like.  I keep browsing colorlib or themezy and findng really good ones.  I would never ever think to make the layout like that, which is why I guess I'm not a UI/UX designer.
