Work has been keeping me busy.  Things have ramped up during the last couple of weeks. Q3 is looking to be pretty busy.  In fact, the whole next year seems to be mapped out already and looks jampacked with external UAT and go live just over the horizon.  The UI work isn't so bad, it's just dependent on backend work, which is rather complicated. 

The integration for the merger is still on going, as is the joint venture.  With that, it looks like we'll be leaving our Hudson Yards location and relocating down to the financial district, even those in the joint venture, which is good news.  I was hoping to not have to relocate again and away from other coworkers within my parent company.  Even with that though, a lot of people seem to have left.  I guess this is the usual turnover for the field but it's still a little saddening to me; a lot of people I sat with have either left the company or relocated to a different office/country.  C'est la vie.  We were notified that we could go back to the office if we felt comfortable enough starting on Monday.  I'm planning on going one day just to check things out and see how it feels again to be among people.  I'm planning on doing it when my coworkers are there so we can finally see each other again in person after a whole year.

In other news, I've posted a lot of my gameplay videos from Xbox, mainly of Battlefield 1, but have started with Battlefield 4 and Battlefield V in anticipation of the new one coming out later this year.  I really enjoy it.  Right now, I've been making shorts of funny and interesting gaming moments as well as posting longer, full length matches.  The longer videos incorporate an intro and other branding elements my brother designed and made for me; it's amazing.  I really enjoy making these videos and have learned a lot about video editing using DaVinci.  I still have yet to post a coding video, and I probably should get going on that, or at least start planning one out, but I don't know what I would want to cover.  Would it be scripting?  Creating a web application?  Would it be doing interesting things with VM and docker?  The first thing that really comes to mind would be to create a custom web element in angular and demonstrate how to use it.  I guess that's a good start.

Any way, it's a crazy feeling know random people are watching my content.  I already have 115 subscribers at the time of writing this with multiple 1K+ and 2K+ view shorts, the highest being 9K+.  I'm not really doing it for the views or the subscribers, but it does feel nice.  I guess I finally understand the allure of redditors posting content.
