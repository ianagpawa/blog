Fixed a bug a work that wasn't covered by a particular scenario.  I hate those. Finalized changes regarding updates regarding user info.  Just need to do some more testing.

I have to figure out how to test a call failure by triggering it on UI with an incorrect value for a request header.  I guess I can hard code it on the Shell.  I have to make sure I pass the authentication via SAM, which then allows us into to open up the Shell portal, which is where the /getUsers call is made.  

Outside of work, I updated the weather app.  Been sluggishly slow.  I need to check the layout and do some fixing up, but overall, I'm ok with it.  I'm aiming to get it up by Wednesday.
