title: Java Spring
---
I started looking into creating a Spring API, I'm planning on using it for my upcoming recommendations.  The most tedious part was installing Java (11 LTS), Gradle and IntelliJ.  I've been reading up creating restful web service with Spring Boot and created a very simple one with just /GET endpoint.  Spring Boot is basically just a starter template made easy, so I need to check out Spring and create something more extensive.
