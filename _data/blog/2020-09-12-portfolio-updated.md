Finished updating my portfolio project and have it up on Github pages.  I like it, at least for now.

I don't like the way Pug doesn't do live reload, I have to keep to keep starting and stopping the server again and again, which is a pain.  I need to look at the Pug watch scripts to figure out why that is.  Regardless, since its a very simple app, it's not that big of problem.
