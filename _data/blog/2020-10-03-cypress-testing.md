I was working on component tests today, adding Cypress testing.  I've been learning a lot of stubbing routes, which is actually helping me understand the interaction with the backend and the data flow, which then helps me understand the code flow on the UI.  

I'm thinking I should add Cypress to my own project.  I need to clean up the code first, then add unit tests, and then the cypress tests.  But, that's after the search bar in weather app, recommendations in blog, revamp portfolio (this one is still a maybe), then do the swagger backend api, which then will be for my music app one. It's on the todo, ca va sans dire.
