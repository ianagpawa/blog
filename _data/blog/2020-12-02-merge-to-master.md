title: Merge to master
---
We finally moved forward with the master merges for the SAM work.  It was months of work to migrate from Ping to SAM, and it's finally done.  There's still work to be done, but getting over the hurdle seemed impossible in the beginning.

In other news, the company, IHS Markit, reached an agreement with S&P Global for a merger.  Completely unexpected news that came out of nowhere.  Looks like S&P Global is looking to grow and increase their position in the market.  It's going to be interesting to see what's going to happen the next few months, particularly as a consultant.

I'm also set to demo the TradeServ platform but also provide a minor KT session on the technical details.  It'll be an interesting task that'll help me practice public speaking and presentation skills.  Hopefully all goes well.
