Started the revamp for my weather app.  I had originally wanted to re-do it in Angular, but decided to just keep it as a React-Redux app.  I used the create-react-app as a starter but won't be using much of it.  I don't like the folder structure, and much of the functionality was not relevant or useful.  



So I'm starting from scratch.  I was able to my initial api calls to work on load; it's pretty simple stuff.  I think i'm going to try to integrate a starter template with it as well.
