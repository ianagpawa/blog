Found a weird pagination bug.  Previous works, but next doesn't.  I can see the slug for next is prepending with the current slug, e.g. /currentSlug/nextSlug which is weird.  Will have to take a look into it, but that's for another day.  

For now, updated some of the styling, mainly the header background color, the positioning of the image in the blog post, and changed the icon on the tab.
