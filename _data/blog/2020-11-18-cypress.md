I've just been focusing on Cypress testing at work.  It's a bit tedious but I don't really mind it.  I like learning about it and creating tests.  It helps me understand the code better but also the functionality.  I've been cranking tests out like crazy.  I've decided to stub all the network calls since the tests should be able to pass on a gitlab runner without an external environment.  Getting the mocked requests and responses is probably the time consuming part of the task.  The second most time consuming is probably getting the tests to work and then refactor to streamline the code using loops over fixtures.

The only other noteworthy thing I've encountered recently was an issue with a gulp task.  Suddenly, a font task is causing npm start to fail, some issue with an error connection, not allowing a call.  It's very weird.  Not sure why its suddenly doing it.  Might be a firewall or Zscalar issue but I've reached out to some people to see what they think.
