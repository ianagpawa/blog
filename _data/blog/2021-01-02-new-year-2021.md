Happy New Year!  Even though I had started working from home in the middle of March, it already feels like its been a year, sometimes it feels like its been forever.  2020 wasn't all bad, there were certainly some good times and moments and I usually do reflect on the past year, this year seems a bit different.  I feel a bit more focused on the idea of progression, of moving forward.  I think that'll be my theme for 2021.
