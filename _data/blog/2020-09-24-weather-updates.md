Worked on a few changes to the weather app.  I added another card to each row so the responsiveness wouldn't break.  Maybe after cleaning everything up, I can work on that part of it, but it's not very urgent; more info on the screen isn't necessarily a bad thing.

Updated the configuration for github, and deploying it from /root of the gh-pages branch.  I need to automate the deploy process; easy as adding scripts in the package.

Need to add the search feature back on there and still need to update the styling for the current day.  Overall, decently satisfied with the overall project, but I probably could've used a better template layout.  I can always rework it later; template is easy.  

This was quite a learning experience; I'm more confident in my React-Redux abilities.  For the next project, I'll try to create another React project.  Maybe it'll be the one I was thinking of; a front page to the internet or something.  It could have a small widget for the current weather; iframe for a random youtube video; rnadom quote; suggestions for movies/shows, and for song on spotify.  For that to work, I'd need to create an API, possibly add swagger to it.  That'll be a big one.  I have no doubt I'll be able to do that, I just need to find a good template layout that I'll like.
